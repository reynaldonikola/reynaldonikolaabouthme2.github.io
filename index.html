    <!-- SHORT STORY -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Roads and Late Nights</h2>
    <p>
      I wrote this short piece about balancing work, school, and family while
      still finding small moments to enjoy life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late shifts, quiet roads. Homework waits beside warm lights. Dreams keep
      moving on.
    </p>

    <!-- INTERESTS -->
    <h2 class="section-title">My personal interests</h2>
    <p>
      I enjoy programming because it feels like solving puzzles that can actually
      help people. I like learning how different parts of a computer work together,
      and I especially enjoy building small projects and seeing them run.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another interest of mine is motorcycles. I like the focus and responsibility
      that comes with riding, and I also enjoy learning about maintenance and safety.
      Riding clears my head and gives me a break from screens and stress.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also enjoy spending time with my family and playing video games when I have
      free time. Games are fun, but they also remind me how creativity and technology
      can work together to build amazing experiences.
    </p>
