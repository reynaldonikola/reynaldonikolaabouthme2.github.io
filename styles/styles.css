        Hi! This is my "About Me" page for Web Programming. I'm a Computer Science student at Utah Valley University,
        and I'm learning how to build websites using HTML and CSS.

    <h2 class="section-title">Roads and Late Nights</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      I wrote this short piece about balancing work, school, and family while still finding small moments to enjoy life.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Late shifts, quiet roads, homework waits beside warm lights. Dreams keep moving on.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">My personal interests</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      I enjoy programming because it feels like solving puzzles that can actually help people. I like learning how different
      parts of a computer work together, and I especially like building small projects and seeing them run. When something
      finally works after debugging, it’s a great feeling.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Another interest of mine is motorcycles. I like the focus and responsibility that comes with riding, and I also enjoy
      learning about maintenance and safety. Riding clears my head and gives me a break from screens and stress, especially
      after long work shifts or a heavy week of classes.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      I also love spending time with my family and playing video games when I have free time. Family keeps me grounded and
      motivates me to keep improving myself. Games are fun, but they also remind me how creativity and technology can work
      together to build amazing experiences.
